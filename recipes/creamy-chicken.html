    <h1>Creamy Garlic Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish features tender, pan-seared chicken breasts smothered in a luscious, garlic-infused sauce. Not only is it incredibly flavorful, but it’s also simple to prepare, making it perfect for a quick weeknight meal. Garlic is the star of the show for this dish, so we’re using lots of it! I love to spoon the garlic over the chicken along with the creamy sauce right before serving.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large boneless skinless chicken thigh</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Flour for dredging</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter divided</li>
        <li>1 whole head garlic cloves peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or stock</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
        <li>Parsley chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken in half lengthwise so you have 4 smaller cutlets. Generously season them with salt & pepper and coat them in the flour.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil and 1 tbsp of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, sauté the chicken for 4-5 minutes/side or until it’s nice and golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium (or even med-low if using cast iron), and add the rest of the butter to the pan. Let it melt and then add the garlic cloves. Cook them for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until they’re lightly browned on the outside.</li> 
        <li>Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and garlic powder to the pan. Let it bubble for around 4 minutes or until the liquid is noticeably reduced. </li>
        <li>Stir in the cream and add the chicken back into the pan. Let it cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the sauce is reduced and the chicken is cooked through. Serve with freshly chopped parsley if you wish.</li>
    </ol>
